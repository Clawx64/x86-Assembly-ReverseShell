# x86-Assembly-ReverseShell
A pure x86 Assembly reverse shell for Windows that connects to a remote listener for command execution. Uses Winsock, Windows Job Objects for process management, and redirects stdin, stdout, stderr to the socket for full interactive control. Includes a C equivalent and a Python listener for testing.
